# Godot DragAndDrop3D plugin
 
A universal Drag and Drop System for Godot version 4.X

## 🌟 Highlights

- 👍 easy to use - only add two nodes to start
- 🛠️ clean code

## 🚀 Usage
<img src="addons/DragAndDrop3D/assets/dragIcon.png" width="16"/> DragAndDrop3D - Add it to your scene to activate the Drag and Drop System

<img src="addons/DragAndDrop3D/assets/dragIcon.png" width="16"/> DraggingObject3D - This must be the Parent of your Object that you want to drag

And you need a floor with a collider, so that the 3D position can be detected.

### Add Script to DraggingObject3D
If you want to add a script on the DraggingObject3D, you have to remove the existing script.
The new script must have as extends DraggingObject3D and the ready function should start with super()

```
extends DraggingObject3D

func _ready():
    super()
```


## ⬇️ Installation

    copy the "addons" folder in your project tree
    
elif you have a "addons" folder already:

    copy the "DragAndDrop3D" folder in your "addons" folder
